# Monoscope Browser SDK

The **Monoscope Browser SDK** is a lightweight JavaScript library for adding **session replay**, **performance tracing**, and **frontend logging** to your web applications.

When used together with the [Monoscope Server SDKs](https://apitoolkit.io/docs/sdks/), you gain **end-to-end observability** — seamlessly connecting user interactions in the browser to backend services, APIs, and databases.

This means you can:

- **Replay user sessions** to see exactly what happened.
- **Trace requests** from the frontend, through your backend, and into your database.
- **Capture logs and errors** with full context for faster debugging.

With the sdk, you can seamlessly monitor how users interact with your app, measure performance, and gain insights into issues — all in one place.

## Installation

Install via **npm/bun**:

```bash
npm install @monoscopetech/browser
```

Or include it directly in your HTML using a `<script>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@monoscopetech/browser@latest/dist/monoscope.min.js"></script>
```

## Quick Start

Initialize Monoscope with your **project ID** and configuration:

```javascript
import Monoscope from "@monoscopetech/browser";

const monoscope = new Monoscope({
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  serviceName: "my-web-app",
  // ...other configuration options
});
```
